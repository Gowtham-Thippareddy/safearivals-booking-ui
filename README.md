# SafeArivals – Ticket Booking Website
SafeArivals is a front-end travel ticket booking website designed to simulate a real-world journey reservation platform. The project focuses on clean UI design, structured layouts, and practical implementation of core web development concepts such as forms, navigation, responsive sections, and reusable components.
This project is not a full commercial booking system — it is a portfolio-level implementation built to demonstrate frontend development skills, user interface structure, and basic booking flow design.

> Features
* Hero booking section with journey date, origin, and destination inputs
* Destination cards with pricing layout
* “Why Choose Us” service section
* Contact form interface
* Multi-page navigation (Home, Destinations, About, Contact)
* Clean travel-themed UI design

> Tech Stack
* HTML5
* CSS3
* JavaScript (Frontend Logic)

> Purpose of the Project
The main goal of SafeArivals is to practice building a structured travel booking interface and improve skills in layout design, form handling, and user experience flow. It serves as a learning project and portfolio showcase rather than a production-ready system.

> What I Learned
* Structuring multi-section landing pages
* Designing reusable card components
* Building responsive layouts
* Organizing frontend project structure

> Future Improvements
* Add backend integration for real ticket booking
* User authentication system
* Dynamic pricing and destination data
* Payment gateway simulation
This project represents my progress in frontend development and my effort to build real-world inspired web interfaces.
